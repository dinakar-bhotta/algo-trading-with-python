We desribe how we constructed it later in this lecture.)\n","\n","Chapter 1  of [[Too14](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id8)] used his graph to show how US GDP started  the 19th century way behind the GDP of the British Empire.\n","\n","By the end of the nineteenth century, US GDP had caught up with GDP of the British Empire, and how during the first half of the 20th century,\n","US GDP surpassed that of the British Empire.\n","\n","For Adam Tooze, that fact was a key geopolitical underpinning for the “American century”.\n","\n","Looking at this  graph and how it set the geopolitical stage for “the American (20th) century” naturally\n","tempts one to want a counterpart to his graph for 2014 or later.\n","\n","(An impatient reader seeking a hint at the answer  might now want to jump ahead and look at figure Fig. 2.7.)\n","\n","As we’ll see, reasoning  by analogy, this graph perhaps set the stage for an “XXX (21st) century”, where you are free to fill in your guess for country XXX.\n","\n","As we gather data to construct those two graphs, we’ll also study growth experiences for a number of countries for time horizons extending as far back as possible.\n","\n","These graphs will portray how the “Industrial Revolution” began in Britain in the late 18th century, then migrated to one country after another.\n","\n","In a nutshell, this lecture records growth trajectories of various countries over long time periods.\n","\n","While some countries have experienced long term rapid growth across that has lasted a hundred years, others have not.\n","\n","Since populations differ across countries and vary within a country over time, it will\n","be interesting to describe both total GDP and GDP per capita as it evolves within a country.\n","\n","First let’s import the packages needed to explore what the data says about long run
